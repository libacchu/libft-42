# libft

## Description
This project is about coding a C library.
It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon.

## Instructions
To begin, you must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the
same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They
will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.

You must write your own function implementing the following original ones. They do
not require any external functions:

• isalpha 
• isdigit 
• isalnum 
• isascii 
• isprint 
• strlen 
• memset 
• bzero 
• memcpy 
• memmove 
• strlcpy 
• strlcat 
• toupper 
• tolower 
• strchr 
• strrchr 
• strncmp 
• memchr 
• memcmp 
• strnstr 
• atoi 

In order to implement the two following functions, you will use malloc():

• calloc
• strdup

## Added
• ft_printf
• get_next_line
